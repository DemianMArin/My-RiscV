  \item Draw the schematic for a single stage processor and fill in your code in the to run the simulator. (20 points)                                                                                                                                  
  \item Draw the schematic for a five stage pipelined processor and fill in your code to run the simulator. The processor should be able to take care of RAW and control hazards by stalling and forwarding. (20 points)                                
  \item Measure and report average CPI, Total execution cycles, and Instructions per cycle for both these cores by adding performance monitors to your code. (Submit code and print results to console or a file.) (5 points)                           
  \item Compare the results from both the single stage and the five stage pipelined processor implementations and explain why one is better than the other. (5 points)                                                                                  
  \item What optimizations or features can be added to improve performance? (Extra credit 1 point)
